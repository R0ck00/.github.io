      <p>Goalkeepers are mainly the unsung heros of each match a team wins. It is the most underrated position. It is generally a position that requires minimal running but a great ammount of reflexes. To become a great goal keeper great arm strength is required because shots are hit over 100mph nowadays along with great intuition of where the striker would go. Goalkeepers are mainly of two types offensive and defensive.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper is the most defensive position in football. The goalkeeper's main job is to stop the other team from scoring by catching, palming or punching the ball from shots, headers and crosses. Unlike their teammates, goalkeepers typically remain in and around their own penalty area for most of the game. As a result, goalkeepers have a better view of the pitch and often give advice to their defence when the other team is on the attack or during set pieces. Goalkeepers are the only players on the pitch who are allowed to handle the ball, but this is restricted to their own penalty area. Positioning is another important job and is one of the hardest to master as keeper.</p>

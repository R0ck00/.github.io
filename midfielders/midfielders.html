      <p>The position is the back bone of the football. Most of the tempo of the game is controlled by the mifeild. It is also said that the team to have a good midfeild will have more possesion of the ball as well as great back line. It comes naturally that with the more ball possesion comes more chances to attack. The midfeild position mainly include Centeral Attacking Midfielder(CAM), Centeral Midfeilder(CM), Centeral Defensive Midfielder(CDM), Left Midfielder(LM) and Right Midfielder(RM).</p>
      <p>Midfielders (originally called half-backs) are players whose position of play is midway between the attacking forwards and the defenders. Their main duties are to maintain possession of the ball, taking the ball from defenders and feeding it to the strikers, as well as dispossessing opposing players. Most managers field at least one central midfielder with a marked task of breaking up opposition's attacks while the rest are more adept to creating goals or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence. Midfielders can be expected to cover many areas of a pitch, as at times they can be called back into defence or required to attack with the strikers. They are more often the players that initiate attacking play for a team.</p>

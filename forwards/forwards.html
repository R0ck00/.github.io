      <p>The position with the most spot light in football. The players with responsiblity to score goals and create chances for other players to score as an secondary option. The forward position mainly include a Striker(ST), Left Winger(LW), Right Winger(RW) and a Center Forward(CF).</p>
      <p>Forwards (or strikers) are players who are positioned nearest to the opposing team's goal. The primary responsibility of forwards is to score goals and to create scoring chances for other players. Forwards may also contribute defensively by harrying opposition defenders and goalkeepers whilst not in possession.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Center Forward(CF)</dt>
        <dd>A centre forward has the key task of scoring goals and for this reason acts as the focal point of the majority of attacking play by a team. As such, how well a striker is performing tends to be measured purely on goals scored despite the fact that they may be contributing in other ways to a team's success. A traditional centre forward was required to be tall in height and strong physically in order to be able to win the ball in the area from crosses and attempt to score with either their feet or head, or to knock the ball down for a teammate to score. </dd>
        <dt>Wingers</dt>
        <dd>A winger (left winger and right winger) (historically called outside-left and outside-right, or outside forward) is an attacking player who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines. They can be classified as forwards, considering their origin as the old outside forward who played out on the "wing" (i.e. side of the pitch). They continue to be termed as such in many parts of the world, especially in Latin and Dutch footballing cultures.</dd>

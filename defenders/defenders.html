      <p>Defending is the most difficult and physical position yo play in football. As the time passes by forwards have developed new skills to trick defenders and to pass by them.
      Defendings consists of positions like Center Back(CB), Left Back(LB), Right Back(RB). Which can be adjusted according to the pace of attack.</p>
      <p>Defenders play behind the midfielders and their primary responsibility is to provide support to the team and to prevent the opposition from scoring a goal.[6] They usually remain in the half of the field that contains the goal they are defending. Taller defenders will move forward to the opposing team's penalty box when their team takes corner kicks or free kicks, where scoring with one's head is a possibility</p>

        <dt>Center Back</dt>
        <dd>The principal role of the centre-back, (or central defender) (historically called a centre-half) is to block the opponent's players from scoring, and safely clearing the ball from the defensive half's penalty area. As their name suggests, they play in a central position. Most teams employ two centre-backs, stationed in front of the goalkeeper. There are two main defensive strategies used by centre-backs: the zonal defence, where each centre-back covers a specific area of the pitch, and man-to-man marking, where each centre-back has the job of covering a particular opposition player.</dd>
